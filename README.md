# University Projects

This folder contains coding assignments completed as part of an MSc in Computer Science at the University of York

## York Grading
This project required the development of a grading system to enable students to check the grade for a particular module as well as the degree as a whole. The ModuleGrader and DegreeGrader prompt the user to input a valid mark and returns a grade. The program was created using Java in Eclipse.

## Search
In this piece of coursework the task was to implement an iterative deepening depth first search algorithm using Java in Eclipse. The algorithm was required to search the grids that were provided and to print the output in a specific way.

## Data Analysis Tool
In this project, Python was used to manipulate datasets, conduct statistical analysis and allow the user to interact with the program and view information via a GUI.

## Facial Expression Recognition CNN
For my MSc dissertation I developed convolutional neural networks for facial expression recognition. The best-performing model demonstrated 64.22% accuracy on the FER-2013 dataset.
